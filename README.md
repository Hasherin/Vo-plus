Simple and lightweight modpack to optimize the vanilla Minecraft experience.

### Performance
The modpack includes [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) and other mods like these to maximize your frames!

### OptiFine Support
Right now the pack doesn't include mods for OptiFine features, however it will be included in the future!

### Beauty, in vanilla?
With [Iris Shaders](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) mod and a default shader set, the game is exceptionally beutiful for an "unmodded" pack, but of course, you can turn the shader off if you would like, and for your eyes, most of the UI is in dark mode, with the help of [Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/resource-packs/) resource pack.

### Everywhere, everytime
Since this modpack only contains client side mods, you can play on any server or world!

### Updated and Supported
Vo+ recieves fast updates and will keep any mod setting if the original mod creator didn't change anything. If you encounter any issues please write it in the GitHub page
